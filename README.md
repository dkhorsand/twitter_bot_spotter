# twitter_bot_spotter
Fill in your API keys and follow the steps to spot potential Twitter bots.

The app as-is requires static image export (setup instructions https://plot.ly/python/static-image-export/)

If you don't want to bother with static image export, in step_3.py:
- delete 'fig.write_image('step_4/most_frequent_tweeters.png', width=450, height=600)'
- add 'fig.show()'
